name: cartoon-3d-short
description: Make a ~55-70 s vertical cartoon story short in the "2D characters in a colourful 3D world" style (flat bean-head cartoon cards with ink outlines, painted 3D town/world with black ink lines, saturated sky, depth-of-field backgrounds, gliding cameras, voice narration, synthesized SFX + march-style music), rendered with three.js inside Remotion. Proven on "The Bridge That Fell for a Song" (2026-10-31). Use when the user asks for another video "like the bridge video", "like the soldiers/bridge short", "in that cartoon 3D style", a history/science story short with cartoon characters in 3D, or says "use the cartoon short skill".

# Cartoon 3D story short (three.js + Remotion)

Proven example: **The Bridge That Fell for a Song**. It is an original 67 s short about the 1831 Broughton bridge and 74 soldiers marching in step.
- Code: `src/videos/bridge/` of your Remotion project (composition `BridgeShort`, 1080x1920, 30 fps).
- Script, voice and sound: `~/bridge-short/`.
- Style research: `references/`.

Second proven example: **The Teaspoon That Calmed a Pond** (2026-11-03), 68 s, Benjamin Franklin stilling a London pond with one teaspoon of oil. Built and rendered entirely in a Linux cloud container.
- Code: `remotion/src/videos/teaspoon/` (composition `TeaspoonShort`), a ready Remotion project in `remotion/` (`npm install` once).
- Script, voice, sound: `projects/teaspoon-pond/` (SCRIPT.md, voice/, audio/sound.py).
- Use it as the template for non-bridge stories: it shows what changes per story (story.ts, cast.ts, world.ts, fx.ts) and what stays (ink, lensblur, grade, shade, lights, paint, cardshade, build, toon).

The style reference is a channel studied privately (`references/`: STYLE_BIBLE.md, reports/*.md, frames/).
- Those videos are private study material. Never upload, publish or send them.
- Never copy their scripts, characters or shots. Story, characters and voice are always OUR OWN.
- Never say the channel's name in a voice-over or description.

User rules that apply:
- No captions or labels in the video.
- English only.
- Voice: one steady tone.
- Jokes are researched real facts.
- Standard mix: music +3 dB, SFX -6 dB, voice unchanged.
- Final export 2K vertical: 1440x2560, `--scale 1.3333333333333333` (exact 4/3; `1.3333` gives a non-integer height and the render fails). 1080x1920 (no `--scale`) when the user asks for 1080p.
- Opus max verifies every check.
- Save after every step.
- "Just do it" once the script is approved.

## Pipeline
1. **Topic and facts.** Pick one surprising true story with a physical cause and effect (it should be visual), plus a simple everyday analogy that explains it.
   - Write the facts with their source at the top of `SCRIPT.md`.
2. **Script** (~3.7 words/s, 55-70 s). Beat formula from the bridge short:
   - **Hook:** the absurd fact in one line ("Seventy-four soldiers knocked down an iron bridge just by walking across it.").
   - **Setting:** year, place, pride.
   - **Action:** escalation over three or four beats, each a little bigger.
   - **Snap:** the moment it breaks.
   - **Deadpan double line:** "Luckily ... / Unluckily ...".
   - **Explanation:** one physics idea through an everyday analogy (the kid on a swing).
   - **Consequence:** the rule it created.
   - **Callback twist:** the ending.
   - Never describe on screen what the viewer already sees.
3. **Voice.** Record or generate `voice.wav`, then make its word timings `words.json` (any speech-to-text with word times).
   - Put them in the project folder, e.g. `~/bridge-short/voice/`.
   - Hand-fix the word timings. Everything is timed to words.json.
4. **Shot plan** in `story.ts`: copy `templates/bridge/` (the final bridge source, same as `src/videos/bridge/` of your Remotion project) to `src/videos/<name>/`, register a new composition next to `BridgeShort` in `src/Root.tsx`, and rename it.
   - `SHOTS`: id, a/b frames, light day/golden, crowd mode, `tau` story time.
   - `XFADE`: crossfades at place/time changes.
   - `FLASH_AT`: a white flash after the hook.
   - `CAMS`: per-shot keys `{f, dur?, cut?, s: f => {pos, look, fov, roll}}`.
   - `KICKS`: impact flip-shakes.
   - `DOF`/`dofAt`: lens blur per beat.
   - `FOREGROUND`: near framing props.
   - Every visual reaction lands 0-3 frames before its word.
5. **World.**
   - `lights.ts`: LIGHTS plus the LOOK sky/river/cloud palette per light.
   - `shade.ts`: two-tone shading and `untone()`.
   - `build.ts`: town, houses and Kenney CC0 kit props, recoloured, with sight-line culling of anything blocking a camera.
   - `paint.ts`: HD Canvas2D painted textures with seams painted in as dark tints.
   - `world.ts`: sky shader, fog = horizon colour, river, per-frame posing, sun frozen per shot and camera-relative.
6. **Characters.**
   - `toon.ts`: the Canvas2D `Pen` drawing API, 600x1000 design canvas, soles at y = 975, bean heads, stick limbs, plum variable-width outline, face library.
   - `cast.ts`: camera-facing billboards, crowds, effect cards, blinks, walk cycles. All billboards go on the `NOINK` layer.
   - `cardshade.ts`: cards lit by the scene light, no emissive.
7. **Post** (`Bridge.tsx` + `ink.ts` + `lensblur.ts` + `grade.ts`).
   - Composer order: ink → lens pre → lens main → bloom → NEUTRAL tone map → grade (MSAA 4).
   - Every pixel parameter scales with output height / 1920.
8. **Sound** (`~/bridge-short/audio/`: timeline.py, sfx_gen.py, sfx.py, music.py, instruments.py, dsp.py, mix.py).
   - Event table → synthesized SFX plus an original score ducked under the voice.
   - Output: mix.wav (48 kHz, exact length), stems and cues.md.
   - Lock the picture's time constants before the sound is made. Any later timing change means re-running the sound.
9. **Look checks.** Run `node scripts/bridge-stills.mjs out/<name>/x_ 100,400 0.5`.
   - Set `BRIDGE_ENTRY=src/sandboxes/<n>/index.tsx` to render a sandbox copy.
   - Make side-by-sides against reference frames with `python scripts/sbs_sheet.py out.jpg --ours ... --ref ...`.
   - Send them to an Opus max verifier: 1-3 images, a ≤200-word verdict.
10. **Final render.**
    - `npx remotion render src/index.ts <Comp> out/<name>/video.mp4 --codec h264 --crf 16 --scale 1.3333333333333333 --timeout 240000`
    - One-command render + mux for the user's own PC: copy `remotion/scripts/render-ice.mjs` (uses `npx remotion ffmpeg`, so no ffmpeg install) and write a short RENDER.md next to the project.
    - Mux with `-map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0` (Remotion writes a silent audio track).
    - QA: `python scripts/short_qa.py final.mp4 out/<name>/qa shots.json` checks every frame for black, white, frozen and pop frames, plus loudness and sheets.
    - Fix anything it finds, then run a deep Opus audit.
11. **Deliver.** SendUserFile the final mp4, update memory, write notes.

## Final look values (bridge after 4 verifier rounds; all in `templates/bridge/`)
Start every new short from `templates/bridge/` (copy to `src/videos/<name>/`): the look lives in these values, the
story lives in story.ts / build.ts layout / cast.ts roles. Opus max scores at the end: colour day 7, golden 5-6,
lighting 5-6, ink 6, textures 5-6, characters 7, depth 6-7, composition 6-7 (from 5/3/4/5/4/7/4/6 at the start).
- **Light presets** (`lights.ts`, sun camera-relative and frozen per shot):
  - day: az 75 / el 48, lit [1.58,1.5,1.33], shade [.30,.29,.36], lift [.05,.06,.11] (cool tint ONLY in shade), sky
    top #3e7fd2 → horizon #b8d0ec, fog = horizon, 25→300 m, uSat 1.08, ~15 % blue haze past 60 m.
  - golden: az 6 / el 7 (backlit low sun), key toward #FFB36B ×1.5, violet-blue shade (facade ≈ #444380), sky
    #ffc47c → #8a6f8a, peach fog only past 50 m, sun disc #ffcf9e + bloom, contact blobs + real card shadows.
- **Albedos** (`paint.ts`/`build.ts`): muted brick / cream / ochre / terracotta houses with plinth, cornice, sills,
  hoods, door step, chimney + pot, heights 7 / 8.4 / 9.8 m; warm grey/beige stone (saturation −35 % from "storybook");
  ochre wood deck C* ~51-58 with near-black seams; iron dark and desaturated. Never lemon, never lavender lit faces.
- **Ink** (`ink.ts`): #030303, 5.1 px near (6 m) → 3.3 px far (90 m) at 1080x1920, creases ×0.8 from 35°, depth
  jumps from 1 %, fog tint 0.3 only far; character cards on layer `NOINK` (they carry their own plum ink).
- **Lens** (`lensblur.ts` + `dofAt` in story.ts): cInf px at 1080: hook/river CU 15-16, close-ups 12-14, MS 10-12,
  park 7, golden sway 5, wides/aerials 0. Focus on the eyes of the front row.
- **Post** (`Bridge.tsx`): ink → lens pre → lens main → bloom (thr 1.0, int .5, 6 levels, radius .6) → NEUTRAL tone
  map → grade; MSAA 4. Film grain exists but is OFF (reference measures no grain; it quadruples the file size).
- **Characters** (`toon.ts`/`cast.ts`/`cardshade.ts`): bean heads h/w .94, plum ink #241726, eyes .26 W apart, no blush,
  14 expressions; adults 3.5 head-heights; walk bob 5 %, lean 1-7°, planted 0.8 m stride; blinks 0.5-2.3 s; tight
  contact shadow ~.5 under the feet + sun-direction tail by day; golden rim inner only (never an offset outer copy).
- **Camera** (`story.ts`): cuts on big jumps, smootherstep glides 18-40 f, every hold creeps (no static hold ≥4 f),
  flip kicks decaying over 7 f on impacts, 4-4.6° rolls, foreground props (`FOREGROUND`) in ~1/3 of shots.

## Look targets (measured from the reference; see references/reports/)
- **Ink:**
  - World lines: about 3 px at 1080 wide, near-black #0b0a0c, nearly constant with distance. Silhouettes, depth jumps and normal creases only. No line on wall/floor joins or the horizon. Character cards are never outlined by the world ink.
  - Character ink: dark plum #201628-#2f1d28, thicker on the bottom/shadow side.
- **Colour:**
  - Day median luma ~.57. Non-ink p5 ~.23 (no crushed blacks). Lit chroma C* p90 ~55. Day sky top ~#5e93d9, horizon 1.28x brighter.
  - Golden: peach horizon #ffd08a, violet-blue shadows (never brown), backlit sun.
- **Depth:**
  - DOF on about 1/3 of screen time (CU, MS, inserts), cInf 10-16 px at 1080, focus on the eyes. Establishing and wide shots stay sharp.
  - Fog = horizon colour, 25→420 m day, 20→360 m golden.
  - Bloom only on HDR emissives: threshold 1.0.
- **Camera:**
  - Hard cuts on big jumps. Everything else is a smootherstep glide of 18-40 f, peak ≤ 25 px/f at 720p.
  - Every hold pushes in 0.15-0.35 %/f, with 0.6 %/f on punch words.
  - Rolls of 4-5°.
  - No hand-held float. Impact shakes flip sign every frame and decay over 7 f.
- **Characters:**
  - About 3.5 head-heights tall, legs 1.4 HH.
  - Stick limbs about 0.055 of head width, ink-dot hands.
  - Bean head (h/w ~0.93, narrower chin, pointier crown).
  - No blush or eye highlights. Faces at brightness ~.93.
  - Walk bob 3-7 %, lean 1-7°, planted feet.
  - Blinks every 0.5-2.3 s, lasting 4 f.

## Look-match loop (how the bridge look was reached; reuse for any "make it look like X" pass)
1. **Measure the reference first.** One analysis agent per topic (motion, depth, textures, characters, lighting, outlines, grade), each writing numbers, not adjectives, to `references/reports/<topic>.md`. Shared brief: `compare/CONTEXT.md`. Reports are the source of truth for every agent after.
2. **Sandboxes, one owner per file.** Copy the project folder to `src/videos/<name>_{cam,world,mat,char,post}` with entries `src/sandboxes/<n>/index.tsx` (same `index.tsx` as main, only the import path changed). Ownership used for the bridge:
   - cam: story.ts (camera keys, cuts, kicks, DOF table, foreground props)
   - world: world.ts, lights.ts, shade.ts, grade.ts (sun, sky, fog, river, colour, grade)
   - mat: paint.ts, build.ts (painted textures, buildings, props)
   - char: toon.ts, cast.ts, cardshade.ts (character drawing, posing, card lighting, fx cards)
   - post: ink.ts, Bridge.tsx, lensblur.ts (outline pass, composer, lens blur, bloom)
   Agents only edit their own files in their own sandbox and render stills with `BRIDGE_ENTRY=src/sandboxes/<n>/index.tsx node scripts/bridge-stills.mjs out/<name>/<n>/x_ <frames> 0.5`.
3. **Merge** with `python scripts/bridge_merge.py [cam,world,mat,char,post]` (backs main up to `backup/bridge_<time>/`, copies owned files only). Then `npx tsc --noEmit` (filter to the project folder), then **re-sync every sandbox from main** (`cp -f src/videos/<name>/* src/videos/<name>_<n>/`) before the next round.
4. **Verify** with a fresh Opus max agent: side-by-side sheets (`python scripts/sbs_sheet.py out.jpg --ours a b --ref r1 r2`), score each area out of 10 (colour day / golden, lighting, ink, textures, characters, depth, composition) plus a numbered fix list with frame numbers. Map each fix to the file owner and resume that owner's agent with SendMessage (keeps its context). Bridge scores: round 1 5/3/4/5/4/7/4/6 → round 2 5/4/5/6/4/7/6/6 → round 3 see notes.
5. Contracts between owners live in exported constants (e.g. `NOINK` layer from ink.ts, `dofAt`/`FOREGROUND` from story.ts, `LIGHTS`/`LOOK` from lights.ts). Changing a contract means telling every owner that reads it.

## Building a new story on the template (learned on the teaspoon short)
- Copy unchanged: `ink, lensblur, grade, shade, lights, paint, cardshade, build, toon`. Write new: `story.ts` (places, shots, camera, DOF), `cast.ts` (keep the canvas pool / Actor / Fx / person / blob / lidAt part of the bridge cast.ts, replace the staging), `world.ts` (keep sky, light rig, clouds and the actor/fx loop of the bridge world.ts), `fx.ts` (story effects).
- `build.ts` imports `D0` from story.ts: export `D0 = 0` for a ground-level world. `setSight(rays)` (exported in the teaspoon copy) lets your own builder use the sight-line culling of `prop()` / `house()`.
- No Kenney files needed: `prop()` draws `tree_*`, `plant_bush*` and `hedge` as cartoon vegetation itself; `loadKit` can return `{}`.
- toon.ts (teaspoon copy) adds outfits `specs`, `apron`, hats `tricorn`, `longhair` (bald crown + grey hair), props `["spoon", tip]`, `"cane"`, `["caneOil", k]`, `["bucket", k]` and poses `shrug`, `clap`. Reuse them instead of redrawing.
- Separate places (pond vs. sea) can share one world: put them ~2.5 km apart, fog hides one from the other; move the cloud ring with the camera.
- Water: one Lambert shader (teaspoon world.ts `WATER_COL`) with cartoon smile-shaped crest marks drifting downwind and a calm mask (circle + capsules). The calm "mirror" colour must be a mid sky blue (#7db4e8 day); the horizon colour reads as white snow at grazing angles.
- Set pieces that belong to one beat (the bedsheet bed) go in their own group and are shown only in that shot.

## Camera traps (9:16)
- `dolly()` moves the camera a fraction of the camera-to-look distance: with a far look point (a wide, an aerial) a 7 % push is 5+ m and runs the lens into the foreground. Use `zoom()` for every wide with a far look point.
- The horizontal half-angle at fov 40 in 9:16 is only ~12 deg: at 2.5 m the frame is ~1.1 m wide. Aim inserts at the prop itself, not at the character.
- A front-view card's hand (stout build) sits ~0.66 m to camera-right and ~1.12 m above the soles: place props, drops and streams from `pos + right * 0.66, y + 1.12`.
- To see a hand prop AND the water below it in one insert, put the lens low (~0.9 m) at ~2.5 m with fov ~46.
- Render a 16-30 still contact sheet (`remotion/scripts/sheet.py`) after every camera change; most early mistakes were framing, not look.

## Cloud container (Linux, no GPU) notes
- Chrome: `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium_headless_shell-*/chrome-linux64/chrome-headless-shell`, `--gl=swangle`. `remotion/scripts/bridge-stills.mjs` reads `CHROME`, `GL`, `COMP`, `REMOTION_TMP`.
- Speed (4 CPUs): ~25-30 s per still; ~11 s per frame for the final at 1440x2560 = ~6 h for 68 s. Render in resumable chunks (`remotion/scripts/render_teaspoon.sh <first> <last>`, 128 frames each, `--concurrency=2 --timeout=240000`), then `finish_teaspoon.sh` joins, muxes and runs QA.
- Scale must be exactly `--scale 1.3333333333333333` (Remotion 4.0.540 rejects 1.3333: height 2559.94 is not an integer). Concurrency 3 timed out frames at 33 s.
- Working versions: remotion 4.0.540, react 18.3.1, three 0.170.0, @react-three/fiber 8.18.0, @react-three/postprocessing 2.19.1, postprocessing 6.39.6.
- Blocked hosts seen: kenney.nl, huggingface.co, openaipublic.azureedge.net, alphacephei.com. pypi, npm and GitHub release assets work.
- Voice without a TTS account: Kokoro via `kokoro-onnx` (the `kokoro` pip package fails on Python 3.13 / spacy), model files from the kokoro-onnx GitHub release. `am_michael` at speed 1.25 put 220 words at 67 s. Generate line by line and keep the line offsets (`lines.json`).
- Word timings without Whisper: pocketsphinx forced alignment per line (`projects/teaspoon-pond/voice/align.py`); add out-of-dictionary words by hand (e.g. bedsheet, dishwater, maths, unluckily).
- Sound: `templates/audio/` is bridge-specific (march, soldiers). For a new story write one `sound.py` on top of `dsp.py`, `instruments.py`, `sfx_gen.py` (see `projects/teaspoon-pond/audio/sound.py`): ambience per place, timed SFX cues in frames, a short original score, ducking from words.json, master -15 LUFS. ~11 min to run. Don't commit the stems (~20 MB each).

## Gotchas
- Kenney nature-kit materials are teal: recolour them by material name in build.ts.
- Cameras end up inside houses: the sight-line culler in build.ts/world.ts removes anything blocking any camera ray.
- Ink in the same merged effect pass as DOF gets overwritten. Ink must be its own pass before the blur.
- Pixel-sized post parameters must scale with resolution: stills are at 0.5, the final at 1.333. R3F clamps dpr to ≥ 1, so `--scale 0.5` stills still render a 1080x1920 buffer.
- **Disk:** every Remotion bundle copies `public/` (~1.3 GB) into `the temp folder\remotion-webpack-bundle-*` and never deletes it. 60+ GB filled the system drive during the bridge passes and a render died with ENOSPC. Always render with `export TEMP='<big drive>/remotion-tmp' TMP='<big drive>/remotion-tmp'` (bridge-stills.mjs sets it itself) and ask the user before deleting old bundle folders in the shared the temp folder (auto mode blocks the sweep). <big drive>/remotion-tmp fills too (~500 folders / 110 GB after the 4 bridge rounds): when a project is finished and nothing is rendering, delete its `remotion-webpack-bundle-*` and `puppeteer_dev_chrome_profile-*` folders there.
- In JS strings write `"<big drive>/remotion-tmp"`, never `"<big drive>\remotion-tmp"` (`\r` becomes a carriage return).
- Remotion writes a silent audio track: mux with `-map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0`.
- Sub-agents can't write report files in this harness: ask them for a ≤150-word final message and save it yourself to `out/<name>/<n>/REPORT.md`.
- Scratch `.ts` files inside `out/` break `tsc`: name them `.txt`.
- 2K renders run ~4 fps (≈10 min for 67 s). Stills at 0.5 take 3-8 s each after a ~40 s bundle.
- Film grain at 2.5 % made the 2K file 910 MB instead of ~250 MB and will turn to mush on YouTube; the reference has none. Keep it off.

- The first frame of a big three.js scene takes longer than Remotion's 30 s default: always pass `--timeout 240000`.
- No GPU (cloud container): render with `--gl swangle --concurrency 1`; concurrency 4 was slower under software GL. Measured ~2.3 s/frame at 1080p and ~3.5 s/frame at 2K (≈80 min / 2 h for 69 s). On a GPU PC try `--gl angle`.
- Kenney GLBs in `public/` are not in git: a fresh clone logs 404s for FOREGROUND props (harmless, props just missing). Copy `public/` over if those props matter.
- Kokoro voices are 24 kHz: resample to 48 kHz (`scipy.signal.resample_poly`) before mixing.
- Dense SFX + march at -15 LUFS pushed the limiter to ~7 dB gain reduction: target -16 LUFS (≤6 dB GR, TP ≤ -1 dBTP).
- Keep `__pycache__/`, `_cache/` and `stem_*.wav` git-ignored; commit only mix.wav, cues.md and a preview mp3.
- When waiting on a process, don't use `pgrep -f "<cmd>"` inside the same shell command line: it matches itself and never ends.

## Readability traps the verifier caught (check every new prop/shot for these)
- **A swing drawn as one rope that disappears behind the kid reads as a HANGING.** Always two ropes to a wide plank
  with the kid between them (`swingKid` in toon.ts), and a frame whose legs clear the arc (A-frame at each end).
- Props or flotsam closer than ~2 m to a lens become huge cut-off blobs at the frame edge. When a camera moves, re-check
  every prop near its new position (the river cameras moved into the floating hats).
- A foreground bush cut by the frame edge reads as a "green ball"; a foreground prop must be recognisable or gone.
- Flags: red + yellow star/diamond reads as Vietnam's. Use a period-correct flag (St George's cross for England 1831).
- Painted signs lit by a side sun go grey-blue and unreadable: give the sign face an unlit material.
- Golden rim light done as an offset outer copy turns every hat into a picture frame: inner rim only, head/torso only.
- Balcony/railing rails at chest height through characters: put the lens ~2.5 m up so rails cross legs, not torsos.
- Flat holds read as freezes in QA (frozen span ≥12 f): every hold needs a creeping push-in.
